CS202, Section 1001

The program starts with some basic documentation: the filename, a short description,
the compiler used, and the modification history. The iostream and fstream header files
are used, along with the std namespace. Only two global variables are used, which limit
the number of cars the program processes data for and the maximum character array length.

The RentalCar struct is initiated, with variables as given in the assignment pdf.

The function prototypes include all the functions used in the program plus the myString...
functions, which are neither implemented nor used in the program.

The main() function only calls UserMenu() and returns 0.

UserMenu() has several char, fstream, bool, and int variables, along with a RentalCar
object, in order to process the data. A while() loop is used, which continues as long
as the continuemenu variable is true. The continuemenu variable is only set to false
within the 7th case of the switch statement, which is the "Exit program" option.

DisplayUserMenu() is self-explanatory, and UserMenu() calls it then allows for a user
input, which is used for the switch statement.
Case 1 asks the user for the name  of an input file, which, if opened, is used to
input data from. If it isn't opened, Error() is called, and the user must try again.
Case 2 prints the car data from the file, unless the file hasn't been used to input
data yet, then an error message is printed.
Case 3 asks the user for an output file name, and, similar to case 1, outputs the car
data to the file, or prints an error message.
Case 4 sorts the cardata by ascending price.
Cases 5 and 6 correspond to parts 5 and 6 of the User Menu as prescribed in the assignment
pdf and complete the necessary actions, using several functions, as defined in the
assignment pdf.
Case 7 is the "Exit program" case, which sets the continuemenu variable to false, thereby
terminating the while function and ending the program.
